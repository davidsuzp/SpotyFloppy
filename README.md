A simple project to connect your Raspberry and a Floppy Disk attached (USB) with a Spotify subscription, reviewing on Internet appears several projects like https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2020-02-05-diskplayer-using-3.5-floppy-disks-to-play-albums-on-spotify/
The idea was reuse my old collection of Disks 2HD 1.44 Mb and useless as of today
The steps to configure this are very simple and tested on Raspberry PI 3B
